The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation in 8 steps: 

1. Download the dataset and extract it in the folder "UCI HAP Dataset"

2. Assign each data to variables

3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

6. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names

7. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

8. Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
